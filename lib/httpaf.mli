(** Http/af is a high-performance, memory-efficient, and scalable web server
    for OCaml. It implements the HTTP 1.1 specification with respect to
    parsing, serialization, and connection pipelining. For compatibility,
    http/af respects the imperatives of the [Server_connection] header when handling
    HTTP 1.0 connections.

    To use this library effectively, the user must be familiar with the HTTP
    1.1 specification, and the basic principles of memory management and
    vectorized IO. *)

(** Protocol Version

    HTTP uses a "<major>.<minor>" numbering scheme to indicate versions of the
    protocol. The protocol version as a whole indicates the sender's conformance
    with the set of requirements laid out in that version's corresponding
    specification of HTTP.

    See {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.6} RFC7230§2.6} for
    more details. *)

(** Header Fields

    Each header field consists of a case-insensitive {b field name} and a {b
    field value}. The order in which header fields {i with differing field
    names} are received is not significant. However, it is good practice to
    send header fields that contain control data first so that implementations
    can decide when not to handle a message as early as possible.

    A sender MUST NOT generate multiple header fields with the same field name
    in a message unless either the entire field value for that header field is
    defined as a comma-separated list or the header field is a well-known
    exception, e.g., [Set-Cookie].

    A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field name
    into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of
    the message, by appending each subsequent field value to the combined field
    value in order, separated by a comma. {i The order in which header fields
    with the same field name are received is therefore significant to the
    interpretation of the combined field value}; a proxy MUST NOT change the
    order of these field values when forwarding a message.

    {i Note.} Unless otherwise specified, all operations preserve header field
    order and all reference to equality on names is assumed to be
    case-insensitive.

    See {{:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2} RFC7230§3.2} for
    more details. *)
