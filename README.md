# http/af

http/af is a high-performance, memory-efficient, and scalable web server for
OCaml. It implements the HTTP 1.1 specification with respect to parsing,
serialization, and connection pipelining as a state machine that is agnostic to
the underlying IO mechanism, and is therefore portable across many platform.
It uses the [Angstrom][angstrom] and [Faraday][faraday] libraries to implement
the parsing and serialization layers of the HTTP standard, hence the name.

## Installation

Install the library and its dependencies via [OPAM][opam]:

[opam]: http://opam.ocaml.org/

```bash
opam install httpaf
```

## Usage

Here is a Hello, World! program written using httpaf. It only responds to `GET`
requests to the `/hello/*` target. As it does not itself do any IO, it can be
used with both the Async and Lwt runtimes. See the [`examples`][examples] directory for
usage of the individual runtimes.

[examples]: https://github.com/inhabitedtype/httpaf/tree/master/examples

```ocaml
open Httpaf
module String = Caml.String

let invalid_request reqd status body =
  (* Responses without an explicit length or transfer-encoding are
     close-delimited. *)
  let headers = Headers.of_list [ "Connection", "close" ] in
  Reqd.respond_with_string reqd (Response.create ~headers status) body
;;

let request_handler reqd =
  let { Request.meth; target; _ } = Reqd.request reqd in
  match meth with
  | `GET ->
    begin match String.split_on_char '/' target with
    | "" :: "hello" :: rest ->
      let who =
        match rest with
        | [] -> "world"
        | who :: _ -> who
      in
      let response_body = Printf.sprintf "Hello, %s!\n" who in
      (* Specify the length of the response. *)
      let headers =
        Headers.of_list
          [ "Content-length", string_of_int (String.length response_body) ]
      in
      Reqd.respond_with_string reqd (Response.create ~headers `OK) response_body
    | _ ->
      let response_body = Printf.sprintf "%S not found\n" target in
      invalid_request reqd `Not_found response_body
    end
  | meth ->
    let response_body =
      Printf.sprintf "%s is not an allowed method\n" (Method.to_string meth)
    in
    invalid_request reqd `Method_not_allowed response_body
;;
```

## Performance

The reason for http/af's existence is [mirage/ocaml-cohttp#328][328], which
highlights the poor scalability of cohttp. This is due to a number of factors,
including poor scheduling, excessive allocation, and starvation of the server's
accept loop. Here is a comparison chart of the data from that issue, along with
data from an async-based http/af server. This server was run on a VM with 3
virtual cores, the host being circa 2015 MacBook Pro:

The http/af latency histogram, relative to the cohttp histograms, is pretty
much flat along the x-axis. Here are some additional statistics from that run
(with latencies in milliseconds):

```
#[Mean    =       27.719, StdDeviation   =       31.570]
#[Max     =      263.424, Total count    =      1312140]
#[Buckets =           27, SubBuckets     =         2048]

## Development

To install development dependencies, pin the package from the root of the
repository:

```bash
opam pin add -n httpaf .
opam install --deps-only httpaf
```

If you use [Nix](https://nixos.org/), you can enter `nix-shell`, which contains dev dependencies including ocaml-lsp.

```bash
nix-shell shell.nix
```

After this, you may install a development version of the library using the
install command as usual.

Tests can be run via dune:

```bash
dune runtest
```
