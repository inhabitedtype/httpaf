(* XXX(seliopou): The current design assumes that a new [Reqd.t] will be
 * allocated for each new request/response on a connection. This is wasteful,
 * as it creates garbage on persistent connections. A better approach would be
 * to allocate a single [Reqd.t] per connection and reuse it across
 * request/responses. This would allow a single [Faraday.t] to be allocated for
 * the body and reused. The [response_state] type could then be inlined into
 * the [Reqd.t] record, with dummy values occuping the fields for [response].
 * Something like this:
 *
 * {[
 *   type 'handle t =
 *     { mutable request        : Request.t
 *     ; mutable request_body   : Response.Body.t
 *     ; mutable response       : Response.t (* Starts off as a dummy value,
 *                                            * using [(==)] to identify it when
 *                                            * necessary *)
